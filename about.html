            <h4>History:</h4>
            <p>
                 The college was established in July 1939.[2] It was named after Sir Azizul Haque, who was vice chancellor of Calcutta University at the time.[3] M. M. Mukherjee was the first principal.
                    
                 The college organised its first classes at Subil Free Primary School in the north side of Bogra town. Later it was transferred to Fulbari Bottola. It was initially only one small straw-shaded room. Marhum Moyen Uddin Pramanik and Marhum Rasidullah Sardar of Fulbari donated land to build the college.
                    
                 In 1941 the college was sanctioned by Calcutta University with the efforts of Sir Azizul Haque, who was Education Minister of Non-Separated Bangal. In 1968 the college was recognized as a government college. The college has two residences. The original 4 acres (0.016 km2) of land is now known as the Old Residence of Azizul Haque College. Only higher secondary classes are administered there. In 1962, through the efforts of Habibur Rahaman (previous Education Minister of the Pakistani government) a new building was established on 55 acres (0.22 km2) of land.
